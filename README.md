# LinkedInto Web-App
StarHacks 2022 Project

## Description ## 
LinkedInto addresses the daunting aspect of LinkedIn where an individual may be unsure as to whether or not they should connect or send a message in fear of bothering the other party, as we know that some people are not always open to connection. It allows users to find individuals who are interested in learning similar things or individuals in the field they want to learn more about who are more than willing to connect.

Users can determine who they want to connect with by looking at profiles which include the person's name, occupation, gender, interests, and a small bio/message.

Inspired by LinkedIn and the wanting to find someone who wants to connect.
